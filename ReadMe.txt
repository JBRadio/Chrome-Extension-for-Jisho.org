This is an *unofficial* Jisho.org Google Chrome Extension

If you wish to install this extension, you will need to do the following:

 -- Server / File system --
1.) Download ZIP from Github to a folder of your choice
2.) Extract ZIP folder contents

 -- Google Chrome --
3.) Open a new tab to chrome://extensions/
4.) Check "Developer mode" at the top
5.) Click "Load unpacked extension..."
6.) Navigate to the extracted folder, click to select, click "Select" button


To use it:
(A) click the new Jisho extension button to access the site in a popup/popover window
(B) select text and then using the right-click context menu to search Jisho.org with that text


Additional Features:
Popup/popover window has two settings: Wide and Narrow (Mobile and Small Tablet sized viewing)
 - Settings are saved so that using the extension again uses the saved viewing settings.
 - "Draw" and "Radical" features work in both view settings.


If the creators of Jisho.org are satisfied with the extension, I'll try to get it on the Chrome Web Store. Otherwise, I hope they can use these files to help get started on their own version of their extension. Much respect goes out to this crew for making a popular and rich Japanese <-> English dictionary experience: Kim Ahlström (@Kimtaro), Miwa Ahlström (@miwa505) and Andrew Plummer (@l_andrew_l).

Icon credits for this project goes to Yaknor (also Jisho.org). Icons in this extension are modified versions of his icon from his public PopClip Jisho.org Search extension (see https://github.com/yaknor/jisho-search).
